  Fibonacci Series
</h>

#### The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two that precede it.
Starting at 1, the sequence looks like this:
> *1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, and so on forever*

<br>

#### The Fibonacci sequence can be described using a mathematical equation:
> *F(n+2) = F(n+1) + F(n)*
