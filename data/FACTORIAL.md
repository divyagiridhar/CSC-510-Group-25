  Factorial ( ! )
</h>

#### The factorial of a number n is presented as ***n!,*** and is defined for a positive integer n as:
> n! = n\*(n-1)\*(n-2)...2\*1. 	

If we take an example, lets say factorial of 5
> 5! = 5\*4\*3\*2\*1 = 120.

#### It isn't mathematics, if there's not a special case in it. There you go, factorial of 0.
> The special case 0! is defined to have value 0! = 1
