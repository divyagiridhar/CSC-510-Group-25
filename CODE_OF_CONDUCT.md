# Contributor Code of Conduct

We all have our own set of values and principles. As a group, there are certain values that we share to help us with our activities and interactions with regard to our project. Honesty, trust, courage and respect are values we believe are present in every endeavour we undertake. We welcome all participants and their ideas that they wish to share.

## Our Pledge

In order to create an open and welcoming environment for all, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior by participants that we encourage include:

- Helping others with suggestions for improvement instead of blaming.
- Being polite when there is a difference of opinion
- Understanding and being sympathetic to our members when an error has been made, since we are all humans and mistakes our inevitable.

Examples of behavior by participants that we discourage include:

- Public or private harassment
- Creating an unwelcoming atmosphere for certain members 
- Discrimination based on gender, religion or other such accidental attributes

## Our Responsibilities

We as a group are responsible for enforcing our standards and take the appropriate actions to ensure that our guidelines are being met.
The community leaders have the right to reject or edit comments/commits, if they aren't meeting the guidelines described.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within the entire community space.

## Enforcement

If behaviour that doesn't meet the community standards or guidelines are reported, the community leaders will take action based on what they feel is appropriate. This could be by offering a correction, by giving a warning, by providing a temporary or permanent ban.
