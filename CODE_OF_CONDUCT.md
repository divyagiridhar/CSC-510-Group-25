# Contributor Code of Conduct

We all have our own set of values and principles. As a group, there are certain values that we share to help us with our activities and interactions with regard to our project. Honesty, trust, courage and respect are values we believe are present in every endeavour we undertake. We welcome all participants and their ideas that they wish to share.

## Our Pledge

In order to create an open and welcoming environment for all, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.
